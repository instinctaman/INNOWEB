Why did the campaign hinge itself on the idea of a “reset,”     How important is it for brands to not return to normal after

We thought this was a great opportunity to push the reset
button and say the opposite of what everyone else was saying.
We knew people were excited to come out of lockdown, and
there was a lot of social noise about the sexual freedom that
people would experience again at the end of lockdown, so
we wanted our campaign story to really talk to people in this
moment. As a brand we want to be as inclusive as possible of
people that have sex, so it was really important that we could
represent as many people as possible in this film, as well as
representing what lockdown looked like for lots of people.
